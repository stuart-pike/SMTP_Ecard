# SMTP_Ecard

Automatically sends birthday wishes via email to friends and family by checking the stored birthdays with the current date using the smtplib, datetime, and pandas libs. The recipient's names, emails, and birthdates are stored in a comma-delimited file and the template birthday wishes (which can easily be modified and increased in variety), are chosen at random, swapping in the name of the recipient.

Hosting this on a service such as Pythonanywhere will take the burden of remembering to run the script each day.
